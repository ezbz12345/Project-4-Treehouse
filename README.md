 phrase hunter, project 4, going for high marks. 


for personalization: 
I added 4 sound effects by creating a sound class, and making 4 instances for win, lose, guess correct (guessHit), and guess incorrect (guessMiss).

changed the background colors of the overlays. 

added shadows to PHRASE HUNTER text, the start game button, and the .chosen class, "lifting" correctly guessed letters. 

Changed the onscreen keyboard colors, and added a strikethrough to letters guessed not in the phrase.
